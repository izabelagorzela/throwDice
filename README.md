#### Task

We implement a die roll in accordance with the following rules:
* Write a function that returns a collection of possible places that the player can move to. Input data is given:
Dislocations (pairs of strings describing the point and teleportation from it), number of sides on die, starting point, final point.
For example: DISLOCATION1 = ["3.1", "4.2"]. If you start from point 0 and throw 3, go to 1, if 4 go to 2 etc. If you start at point 2 and throw 3, you are in point 5 and you don't teleport.
* The output collection may not contain duplicates.
